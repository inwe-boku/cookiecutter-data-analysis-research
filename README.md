# Cookiecutter Data Research

This is a [cookiecutter template](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) for research projects. It
aims at projects which involve computation of results or some kind of data analysis and where the
results are then described in a scientific article using figures, tables and single values.

The cookiecutter template is mostly based on [drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). Some choices are inspired by other articles (see [references](#references)).

## How to use

After [installing cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#installation) run:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/inwe-boku/cookiecutter-data-research
